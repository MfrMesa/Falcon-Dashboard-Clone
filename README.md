# Falcon-Dashboard-Clone

Project carried out as an evaluation of the Develhope Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.

I directed and led this project, where our main objective was to make a clone of the Falcon Dashboard Landing Page.

My main responsibility was the creation of the sidebar, the shopping cart and the structure of the central cards. Additionally, we efficiently manage our work using tools like Trello for task management and Github for version control.

We faced various challenges during the project, from implementing complex functionalities to team coordination and time management. We overcome these challenges with a collaborative and purposeful approach, leveraging our individual skills and working closely to achieve our goals.

Delivered within a month. We are proud of our work and the collaboration that led to the success of the project.
